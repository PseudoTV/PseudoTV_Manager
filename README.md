PyPTVMan
========
This is a fork of the channel managers built for PseudoTV and PseudoTVLive. The intention of this fork is to port the application to Python2 and PyQt4 from Visual Basic.

Why?
====
- Python2 and PyQt4 run very well and easily on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- A port using those technologies can be made to look nearly identical to the current application.
- Python and PyQt are arguably more accessible and easier to debug compared to Visual Basic.
- Python is THE programming language used by most Kodi/XBMC addon developers, which would include the host PseudoTV Live application.
